# Make a New Friend with no End!
> Our telegram bot @MakeANewFriBot aims to help users start or continue a conversation with their new friends by allowing users to choose a category they like, then randomly generating a relevant question that can spark discussions, laughters, and definitely friendship! 
> Furthermore, relevant links to our webpage will also be sent at the same time to enhance and guide the conversation.

## General info
The purpose of this project is to serve as a platform to aid users in carrying endless conversations with their new friends on telegram, as facilitated by our wide diversity of categories and a website that brings users to explore even more. 

With the increased amount of time spent online as opposed to face-to-face due to the pandemic, people may feel a sense of distance with their friends as conversations end quickly (or worse still, no one starts a conversations as they do not know what to talk about). Hence this bot and website will aid users in sustaining friendships through meaningful conversations and possible (covid-safe) explorations of Singapore.
